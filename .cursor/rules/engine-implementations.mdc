# engine-implementations

The engine implementations focus on two core components that handle temporal alignment for cursor precision control:

## Full Engine (Importance: 95)
Located in `Sources/DragobooCore/PointerScaler.swift`, the Full Engine handles:

- Event tap creation at `.cgSessionEventTap` level for global event interception
- Delta value scaling for mouse movements and scroll events based on precision factor
- Real-time fn key state detection through dual methods:
  - Primary: Event flags checking for .maskSecondaryFn
  - Secondary: Key state polling via CGEventSource
- Event modification pipeline for scaled cursor movement

## Mask Engine (Importance: 90)
Located in `Dragoboo/DragobooApp.swift`, the Mask Engine manages:

- Precision mode state tracking and transitions
- Event filtering based on fn key state
- Temporal alignment between user input and cursor response
- Dynamic precision factor application

## Integration Points (Importance: 85)

The engines communicate through:
- Direct event tap callbacks from Full to Mask engine
- State synchronization for precision mode activation
- Delta value transformations based on current precision factor
- Event pipeline coordination for seamless cursor control

## Event Types Handled
Both engines process:
- mouseMoved
- leftMouseDragged
- rightMouseDragged
- otherMouseDragged  
- scrollWheel
- flagsChanged

The dual-engine architecture ensures reliable temporal alignment between user input and cursor response while maintaining system-wide event handling capabilities.
