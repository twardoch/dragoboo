# frame-models

After reviewing the provided specification, there appears to be no explicit frame-models or video processing pipeline data structures documented in the source material. The specification describes a mouse/trackpad precision control utility (Dragoboo) and does not contain any video frame processing or related data models.

The closest related data structures are:

- Event handling models in `PointerScaler.swift` for processing mouse/trackpad input events
- State management in `AppState` for tracking precision mode status
- UI models in `ContentView.swift` for displaying the menu bar interface

However, these are not frame or video processing related models.
