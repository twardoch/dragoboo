I'll run the `run.sh` script and check its output for you.

I can see the output from running `run.sh`. There are several issues that need to be addressed:

## Issues Identified:

1. **Shell configuration warnings**: The script is trying to use bash-specific options that aren't available in the current shell
2. **Missing xcpretty**: The build tool `xcpretty` is not installed
3. **NVM not found**: The script references `/Users/adam/.nvm/nvm.sh` which doesn't exist
4. **CoreSimulator version mismatch**: The CoreSimulator framework is outdated (1010.10.0) compared to what Xcode expects (1010.15.0)
5. **macOS using zsh by default**: The system is suggesting to switch from bash to zsh

## Solutions:

Let me first check the content of the `run.sh` script to understand what it's trying to do: Now let me check the rest of the script: Now I understand the script better. The main issues are:

1. **CoreSimulator version mismatch** - This is the most critical issue preventing the build
2. **Missing xcpretty** - This is a nice-to-have tool for prettier xcodebuild output

Let me check if the build actually succeeded despite the warnings:
