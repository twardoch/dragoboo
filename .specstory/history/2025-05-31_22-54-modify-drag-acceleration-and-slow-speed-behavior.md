# Modify drag acceleration and slow speed behavior (2025-06-01 00:54:22)

_**User**_

Remove the "Select the modifier keys to activate" completely

Add a modifiers section to the Drag acceleration line, same as for the Slow speed. If all modifiers off, the Drag acceleration should work regardless of modifiers. If modifiers are selected, Drag acceleration should work only if the modidifer is held (but additional modifiers may be held). 

If the same modifier is selected for Drag acceleration and Slow speed,and that modifier is pressed, then the Slow speed should take precedence (so basically choosing the same modifiers for both functionalities basically renders Drag acceleration absent. That's OK.

Now let me read more of the PrecisionEngine to understand the current logic for handling modifiers:

---

Read file: Sources/DragobooCore/PrecisionEngine.swift

---

Now I understand the current implementation. Let me also check what the current TODO.md says to understand the current priorities:

---

Read file: TODO.md

---

Now I have a good understanding of the current implementation. Let me think through what needs to be changed based on the user's requirements:

---



---



---



---



---



---

Perfect! Now I have a clear implementation plan. Let me start by implementing the changes step by step.

## Step 1: Update AppState to support drag acceleration modifiers

---

```diff
      // v2.0: Configurable modifier keys
      @AppStorage("modifierKeysData") private var modifierKeysData: Data = Data()
+     
+     // v2.0: Drag acceleration modifier keys
+     @AppStorage("dragAccelerationModifierKeysData") private var dragAccelerationModifierKeysData: Data = Data()
      
      // v2.0: Drag acceleration settings
```

```diff
          }
      }
+     
+     var dragAccelerationModifierKeys: Set<ModifierKey> {
+         get {
+             guard let decoded = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Set<ModifierKey>.self, from: dragAccelerationModifierKeysData) else {
+                 return [] // Default to no modifiers (always active when dragging)
+             }
+             return decoded
+         }
+         set {
+             dragAccelerationModifierKeysData = (try? JSONEncoder().encode(newValue)) ?? Data()
+             precisionEngine?.updateDragAccelerationModifierKeys(newValue)
+         }
+     }
      
      // Fixed: 100% = normal speed (factor 2.0 baseline), below 100% = slower
```

```diff
          // Configure settings
          precisionEngine?.updateModifierKeys(modifierKeys)
+         precisionEngine?.updateDragAccelerationModifierKeys(dragAccelerationModifierKeys)
          precisionEngine?.updateAccelerationRadius(accelerationRadius)
          precisionEngine?.updateSlowSpeedEnabled(slowSpeedEnabled)
```

```diff
          modifierKeys = keys
      }
+     
+     func toggleDragAccelerationModifierKey(_ key: ModifierKey) {
+         var keys = dragAccelerationModifierKeys
+         if keys.contains(key) {
+             keys.remove(key)
+         } else {
+             keys.insert(key)
+         }
+         dragAccelerationModifierKeys = keys
+     }
      
      func updateSlowSpeedPercentage(_ percentage: Double) {
```

---

## Step 2: Update PrecisionEngine to handle two modifier sets

---

```diff
      // v2.0: Configurable modifier keys
      private var modifierKeys: Set<ModifierKey> = [.fn]
+     
+     // v2.0: Drag acceleration modifier keys
+     private var dragAccelerationModifierKeys: Set<ModifierKey> = []
      
      // v2.0: Feature toggles
```

```diff
      private var isDragging = false
      private var currentDragDistance: Double = 0.0
+     
+     // v2.0: Modifier state tracking
+     private var isSlowSpeedModifiersActive = false
+     private var isDragAccelerationModifiersActive = false
      
      public var onPrecisionModeChange: ((Bool) -> Void)?
```

---

```diff
          logger.info("Updated modifier keys: \(keys)")
      }
+     
+     // v2.0: Update drag acceleration modifier keys
+     public func updateDragAccelerationModifierKeys(_ keys: Set<ModifierKey>) {
+         dragAccelerationModifierKeys = keys
+         logger.info("Updated drag acceleration modifier keys: \(keys)")
+     }
      
      // v2.0: Update drag acceleration radius
```

---

Read file: Sources/DragobooCore/PrecisionEngine.swift

---

Now I need to update the handleFlagsChanged method to handle both modifier sets with precedence:

---



---

Now I need to update the calculateEffectivePrecisionFactor method to respect the new modifier states:

---



---

Also need to update the condition in modifyMovementEvent to check the new modifier state:

---



---

## Step 3: Update UI to show drag acceleration modifiers

First, let me make the ModifierKeyButtons component reusable:

---



---

Now update the SlowSpeedToggleView to use the new reusable component:

---



---

Now remove the warning text from SlowSpeedToggleView:

---



---

Now update the DragAccelerationToggleView to include modifier buttons:

---



---

Let me test the build to see if there are any compilation issues:

---

```bash
cd /Users/adam/Developer/vcs/github.twardoch/pub/dragoboo && swift build
```

Good! The build succeeds with just some warnings about unused variables. Let me clean those up:

---



---

Let me test the build again to make sure the warnings are gone:

---

```bash
swift build
```

```
adam@Hamlet dragoboo % swift build

---

Perfect! No more warnings. Now let me test the app to make sure everything works:

---

```bash
./run.sh
```

---

Let me also update the TODO.md to reflect the completed work:

---

Read file: TODO.md

---



---

Now let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented all the requested features:

### ‚úÖ **Removed "Select modifier keys to activate" text**
- Completely removed the orange warning text that appeared when no modifiers were selected for slow speed
- The UI is now cleaner without this prompt

### ‚úÖ **Added modifiers section to Drag acceleration**
- Drag acceleration now has its own set of configurable modifier keys, displayed as buttons similar to slow speed
- The modifier buttons appear to the right of the "Drag acceleration" toggle when the feature is enabled
- Uses the same visual design and interaction pattern as slow speed modifiers

### ‚úÖ **Drag acceleration behavior with modifiers**
- **No modifiers selected**: Drag acceleration works regardless of which keys are held (default behavior)
- **Modifiers selected**: Drag acceleration only works when those specific modifiers are held during dragging
- Additional modifiers can be held alongside the required ones

### ‚úÖ **Precedence system implemented**
- When the same modifier is selected for both Slow speed and Drag acceleration, **Slow speed takes precedence**
- This means if you select `fn` for both features and press `fn`, only slow speed will be active
- Drag acceleration will be disabled when there's modifier overlap and those overlapping modifiers are pressed

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

**AppState changes:**
- Added `@AppStorage("dragAccelerationModifierKeysData")` for persistence
- Added `dragAccelerationModifierKeys` computed property
- Added `toggleDragAccelerationModifierKey()` method

**PrecisionEngine changes:**
- Added separate tracking for `isSlowSpeedModifiersActive` and `isDragAccelerationModifiersActive`
- Implemented precedence logic in `handleFlagsChanged()`
- Updated `calculateEffectivePrecisionFactor()` to respect modifier states
- Added `updateDragAccelerationModifierKeys()` method

**UI changes:**
- Made `ModifierKeyButtons` component reusable with parameters
- Added modifier buttons to `DragAccelerationToggleView`
- Removed the warning text from `SlowSpeedToggleView`

The implementation maintains backward compatibility and follows the existing code patterns. The app builds successfully and the new functionality is ready for testing.

**Wait, but** let me think about this implementation and see if there are any edge cases or improvements needed...

Actually, let me consult with my virtual team to review this implementation:

**Ideot**: "Hey, this looks solid! The precedence system is elegant - when users select the same modifier for both features, they get the more precise slow speed behavior rather than the accelerating drag behavior. That makes intuitive sense!"

**Critin**: "Good point, but I'm wondering about the user experience. What if someone accidentally selects the same modifiers for both features? Should we add some visual indication or warning? Also, the drag acceleration active state is currently hardcoded to `false` in the UI - we might want to track that properly for visual feedback."

**Me**: "Critin raises good points. However, the user specifically said that having the same modifiers for both features 'basically renders Drag acceleration absent. That's OK.' So they're aware of this behavior and accept it. For now, let's keep it simple as requested. The visual feedback for drag acceleration active state could be a future enhancement."

**Ideot**: "What about testing? We should make sure the modifier precedence works correctly in all scenarios."

**Critin**: "Agreed. Also, the coordinate system handling and multi-display support mentioned in the TODO might be affected by these changes, though probably not significantly."

**Me**: "The core event handling logic remains the same, so multi-display support shouldn't be affected. The changes are primarily in the modifier detection and precedence logic. The implementation follows the existing patterns and maintains the same event processing pipeline."

Overall, I believe this implementation correctly addresses all the user's requirements while maintaining code quality and following the established patterns. The precedence system is clear and predictable, and the UI changes provide the requested functionality without cluttering the interface.

---

_**User**_

With both Drag acceleration and Slow speed, the modifiers are supposed to be "AND", that is if I turn on fn and opt, then the functionality should only work when I press fn AND opt. Right now it works on "OR"
