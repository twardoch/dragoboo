## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Logic

Dragoboo implements a precision cursor control system with the following key components:

### Precision Control Engine
- Temporary cursor slowdown activation via fn key
- Configurable slowdown factor (1x-10x)
- Unified scaling for both cursor movement and scroll wheel input
- Fractional movement accumulation system for smooth scaling
- Universal compatibility with trackpads and mice

### Event Processing Pipeline
- System-wide event tap for input capture
- Continuous fn key state monitoring 
- Delta value transformation with accumulator logic
- Multi-event type handling (movement, dragging, scrolling)

### Permission Management
- macOS Accessibility permission validation
- User permission flow orchestration
- Runtime permission state monitoring
- Graceful degradation on permission loss

### State Coordination
- Centralized AppState management
- Precision mode status tracking
- Settings persistence
- UI feedback coordination

## Critical Files

- `/Sources/DragobooCore/PointerScaler.swift`: Core scaling engine
- `/Sources/DragobooApp/DragobooApp.swift`: Application coordinator
- `/Sources/DragobooApp/ContentView.swift`: Settings interface

## Data Flow

1. Input events captured via system event tap
2. Events processed through PointerScaler
3. Scaled events injected back to system
4. State changes propagated to UI

The system maintains smooth cursor control through fractional accumulation while ensuring proper permission handling and state management across the application lifecycle.
