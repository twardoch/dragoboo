# TODO.md

Analyze `llms.txt`, and analyze and revise `PLAN.md`. Do as follows: 

1. Rewrite `README.md` to include extensive documentation that explains exactly how the app works technically, and how to use it. 

2. From `PLAN.md`, completely remove things that are done. 

3. Think hard (and consult with other LLMs) on how the codebase can be improved. Analyze which parts are not well-written, and which are not necessary. We’ve gone through multiple iterations and rewrites. Now it’s time to do a comprehensive REWRITE basically from scratch, that will cleanly implement the functionality (so that it works), but trims off the fluff. 

In `PLAN.md`, reduce the number of to-do items to a healthy minimum. Remove some nice-to-haves. Instead, document the REWRITE plan there. Restructure the `PLAN.md` so that it becomes a clear, easy to follow step-by-step guide for a junior dev that outlines exactly how the rewrite needs to be done. Include annotated code samples, include rationale. Don't actually write any code yet, just review, revise, think, double-check, review, revise again — all inside the `PLAN.md` document.
