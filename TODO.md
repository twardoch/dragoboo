So, the UI looks good. But: 

- [ ] The menubar icon looks find but when fn is not active, the icon is narrow, and when fn is active, the icon is wide, so when I press and release fn, the neighboring menubar icons shift. This adds a lot of visual noise. 
- [ ] The menubar dropdown widget becomes taller when I press fn because the extra line appears, and becomes shorter when I release fn. This adds a lot of visual noise. 
- [ ] Most importantly: the app does NOT influence the speed of the pointer (cursor) at all, no matter if I press or release fn.
