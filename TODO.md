# TODO.md - Dragoboo Development Tasks

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Critical Safety Fixes (2025-05-31)

### üö® CRASH & PERMANENT SLOWDOWN ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem Fixed:** Dragoboo was causing crashes that logged users out of macOS and left trackpad permanently slow.

**Root Cause:** UserDefaults approach in SystemSpeedController permanently modified system preferences:
- Set `com.apple.trackpad.scaling` to extremely low values (e.g., 0.04296875)
- Disabled acceleration entirely (`com.apple.trackpad.acceleration = -1`) 
- These changes persisted after app crashes, leaving users with broken trackpad/mouse

**Solution Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Replaced SystemSpeedController with direct event modification in PointerScaler**
- ‚úÖ **Event tap now modifies mouse/trackpad events directly** (safer, temporary)
- ‚úÖ **Disabled dangerous UserDefaults approach** (commented out with warnings)
- ‚úÖ **Added proper cleanup and crash protection**
- ‚úÖ **Created recovery script** (`recovery_trackpad.sh`) for affected users

**Technical Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Modified `PointerScaler.swift` to intercept and scale movement/scroll events
- ‚úÖ Removed dependency on `SystemSpeedController` from `PointerScaler`
- ‚úÖ Added signal handlers for graceful cleanup
- ‚úÖ Added proper memory management for IOKit resources
- ‚úÖ Event modifications are now temporary and don't persist after crashes

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Testing & Validation ‚è∞ **Next 1-2 days**

- [ ] **Manual Testing:** Verify fn key + cursor slowdown works with new event modification
- [ ] **Crash Testing:** Force quit app while precision mode active - verify no permanent changes
- [ ] **Multiple App Testing:** Test with various apps (browsers, design tools, games)
- [ ] **Performance Testing:** Verify no input lag or jittery movement
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing:** Test with external mice, trackpads, graphics tablets

### Phase 2: Documentation & User Communication

- [ ] **Update README.md** with safety improvements and recovery instructions
- [ ] **Create user guide** for recovery script usage
- [ ] **Document architecture change** (event modification vs system preferences)
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting section** for common issues

### Phase 3: Code Cleanup & Polish

- [ ] **Remove unused code** in SystemSpeedController (keep IOKit for future use)
- [ ] **Fix compiler warnings** (unreachable catch blocks)
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling** for event modification failures
- [ ] **Optimize event filtering** (reduce unnecessary processing)

## üîÆ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Advanced Precision Control
- [ ] **Variable scaling factors** based on cursor velocity
- [ ] **Application-specific settings** (different factors per app)
- [ ] **Gesture-based activation** (three-finger tap, corner trigger)
- [ ] **Multiple precision levels** (fine, ultra-fine, pixel-perfect)

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Visual cursor feedback** (size/color change in precision mode)
- [ ] **Audio feedback** (optional click sounds)
- [ ] **Temporary precision mode** (hold for 3 seconds, auto-deactivate)
- [ ] **Smart activation zones** (precision mode near UI edges)

### System Integration
- [ ] **Menu bar icon animations** (visual feedback for precision state)
- [ ] **System preferences integration** (appear in System Settings)
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcut customization** (beyond just fn key)
- [ ] **Multi-device support** (different settings per input device)

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY & RELIABILITY

### Robustness
- [ ] **Input lag monitoring** (warn if processing takes too long)
- [ ] **Automatic fallback modes** (if event tap fails)
- [ ] **Resource usage monitoring** (CPU, memory usage tracking)
- [ ] **Graceful degradation** (reduce functionality vs crash)

### User Protection
- [ ] **Settings backup/restore** (save user preferences safely)
- [ ] **Automatic recovery detection** (detect if system is in broken state)
- [ ] **Safe mode operation** (minimal functionality if issues detected)
- [ ] **Comprehensive logging** (help diagnose user issues)

## üìã DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Unit tests for core logic** (precision scaling calculations)
- [ ] **Integration tests** (fn key detection + event modification)
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** (input latency measurements)
- [ ] **Memory leak detection** (especially for IOKit resources)

### Documentation
- [ ] **Architecture documentation** (explain event tap approach)
- [ ] **API documentation** (for future contributors)
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** (common issues and solutions)
- [ ] **Development setup guide** (for contributors)

## üö® SAFETY NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

**NEVER AGAIN:**
- ‚ùå Don't modify permanent system preferences (`com.apple.*.scaling`, `com.apple.*.acceleration`)
- ‚ùå Don't use `CFPreferencesSetValue` for mouse/trackpad settings
- ‚ùå Don't disable system acceleration permanently
- ‚ùå Don't rely on cleanup that might not run during crashes

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Use event tap modification for temporary changes
- ‚úÖ Ensure all changes are automatically reverted when app exits
- ‚úÖ Test crash scenarios thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Provide recovery mechanisms for users
- ‚úÖ Document why certain approaches are dangerous
