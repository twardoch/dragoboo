# TODO.md - Dragoboo Development Tasks

## ✅ COMPLETED: Critical Safety Fixes (2025-05-31)

### 🚨 CRASH & PERMANENT SLOWDOWN ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem Fixed:** Dragoboo was causing crashes that logged users out of macOS and left trackpad permanently slow.

**Root Cause:** SystemSpeedController permanently modified system preferences:
- Set `com.apple.trackpad.scaling` to extremely low values (e.g., 0.04296875)
- Disabled acceleration entirely (`com.apple.trackpad.acceleration = -1`) 
- These changes persisted after app crashes, leaving users with broken trackpad/mouse

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Replaced SystemSpeedController with direct cursor warping in PointerScaler**
- ✅ **Event tap now uses `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` for safe, temporary control**
- ✅ **Disabled all permanent system preference modifications**
- ✅ **Created recovery script for users affected by earlier versions**
- ✅ **Added comprehensive crash safety measures**

### 🎯 PRECISION MODE BREAKTHROUGH 
**Achievement:** Full precision cursor control now working perfectly using cursor warping approach.

**Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ **Event interception:** System-wide event tap captures all movement events
- ✅ **fn key detection:** Reliable detection via `.maskSecondaryFn` flags
- ✅ **Movement scaling:** Fractional accumulation algorithm for smooth precision
- ✅ **Cursor warping:** Direct position control via `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`
- ✅ **Event consumption:** Original events blocked to prevent double movement

**User Experience:**
- ✅ **Instant activation:** Hold fn key for immediate precision mode
- ✅ **Configurable scaling:** 1x to 10x slowdown factor (default: 5x)
- ✅ **Visual feedback:** Menu bar icon shows active state
- ✅ **Settings persistence:** Configuration saved across app restarts
