# Dragoboo Development Plan

_Consolidated project roadmap and implementation status_

## üéâ PROJECT STATUS: CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE

## üî¨ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Precision Control Algorithm

```swift
// Core scaling algorithm with accumulation
accumulatedX += deltaX / precisionFactor
accumulatedY += deltaY / precisionFactor

let scaledX = Int(accumulatedX)
let scaledY = Int(accumulatedY)

accumulatedX -= Double(scaledX)
accumulatedY -= Double(scaledY)

// Direct cursor control
let newPosition = CGPoint(
    x: lastCursorPosition.x + Double(scaledX),
    y: lastCursorPosition.y + Double(scaledY)
)
CGWarpMouseCursorPosition(newPosition)
```

### Event Processing Flow

1. **Event Interception:** `.cgAnnotatedSessionEventTap` captures all input events
2. **fn Key Detection:** Monitor `.maskSecondaryFn` flag in flagsChanged events
3. **Movement Processing:** Apply precision scaling when precision mode active
4. **Cursor Warping:** Direct position control bypassing system event processing
5. **Event Consumption:** Block original events to prevent double movement

### Safety Architecture

- **Temporary Modifications:** All changes revert automatically on app exit
- **No System Preferences:** Eliminated dangerous UserDefaults modifications
- **Crash Recovery:** Signal handlers and cleanup ensure system restoration
- **Permission Validation:** Accessibility requirements clearly communicated
