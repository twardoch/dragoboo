# Dragoboo Development Plan

**Status: v2.0 Released** ‚úÖ

## üéØ Current State

Dragoboo v2.0 is feature-complete with two powerful precision control modes:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### **Slow Speed Mode**
- Configurable modifier keys (`fn`, `‚åÉ`, `‚å•`, `‚åò`)
- Percentage-based speed control (5-100%)
- Visual feedback with green highlighting
- Can be completely disabled via empty modifier set

#### **Drag Acceleration**
- Works independently without modifiers
- Distance-based acceleration with configurable radius
- Starts at slow speed slider setting
- Smooth cubic easing to normal speed

#### **Modern UI**
- Compact 300px design
- Toggle-based feature control
- Real-time slider feedback
- Clean menu bar integration

## üöÄ Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Polish & Optimization (Near Term)

- [ ] Optimize event processing for 120Hz+ displays
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations in hot paths
- [ ] Add performance monitoring/debugging mode

#### Multi-Display Support
- [ ] Test edge cases with multiple monitors
- [ ] Handle display arrangement changes gracefully
- [ ] Ensure coordinate system consistency across displays
- [ ] Add per-display configuration options

#### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Optional on-screen overlay showing active mode
- [ ] Visual indicator for drag acceleration progress
- [ ] Customizable menu bar icon states
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver support)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Medium Term)

#### Application Profiles
- [ ] Per-app precision settings
- [ ] Auto-switch based on active application
- [ ] Quick profile switching via hotkeys
- [ ] Import/export profile configurations

#### Alternative Activation Methods
- [ ] Double-tap modifier for toggle mode
- [ ] Gesture-based activation (trackpad)
- [ ] Mouse button combinations
- [ ] Time-based activation (hold for X seconds)

#### Enhanced Drag Modes
- [ ] Multiple acceleration curves (linear, exponential, custom)
- [ ] Directional acceleration (horizontal/vertical bias)
- [ ] Pressure-sensitive acceleration (for Force Touch)
- [ ] Acceleration zones (different speeds in screen regions)

### Phase 3: Integration & Ecosystem (Long Term)

#### Professional Tool Integration
- [ ] Adobe Creative Suite integration
- [ ] CAD software optimization
- [ ] 3D modeling app support
- [ ] Video editing precision modes
