I’m on macOS and I use the trackpad. I want a macOS app that, when I hold the `fn` key would temporary increase the movement precision (the translation of physical trackpage movement to pixels) by a customized value, defaulting to 4. In other words, the pointer (cursor) should become 4x "slower". Research the topic, look for existing solutions, look for the right APIs to call, draft a plan for writing such an app (preferrably written in Swift), create the skeleton and show implementation of the key functionalities.

# Grok report

### Key Points
- **Objective**: Create a macOS app that temporarily slows trackpad cursor movement by a customizable factor (default 4x) when holding the `fn` key.
- **Feasibility**: Likely achievable using Quartz Event Services to intercept and modify mouse movement events, though it requires accessibility permissions.
- **Existing Solutions**: No existing apps were found that precisely meet this requirement, suggesting a custom solution is needed.
- **Implementation**: A Swift-based status bar app using `CGEventTap` to adjust trackpad event deltas seems promising, but modifying mouse movement events may face system restrictions.
- **Considerations**: The app requires accessibility permissions, and the `fn` key’s detection is supported via event flags, but effectiveness may vary across macOS versions.

### Overview
You want a macOS app that makes the trackpad cursor move more precisely (slower) when you hold the `fn` key, with a default slowdown factor of 4x that you can customize. This means the cursor should cover fewer pixels for the same physical trackpad movement, making fine adjustments easier. Based on research, this can likely be achieved by creating a Swift app that uses macOS’s Quartz Event Services to intercept trackpad events and adjust their movement data. However, no existing app perfectly matches your needs, so a custom solution is necessary. Below, I outline a plan and provide a code skeleton to implement this functionality.

### Why This Approach?
The macOS system allows adjusting trackpad speed globally through System Preferences, but there’s no built-in way to toggle this dynamically with a key press. By intercepting trackpad events (which macOS treats as mouse movement events) and modifying their movement deltas when the `fn` key is pressed, we can achieve the desired effect. The `CGEventTap` API is ideal for this, as it allows real-time event modification, though it requires accessibility permissions to function.

### Implementation Plan
The app will be a status bar application written in Swift, running in the background to monitor trackpad events. When the `fn` key is held, it will reduce the cursor’s movement speed by scaling down the event’s delta values. A simple menu will allow quitting the app, and the slowdown factor can be hardcoded initially, with potential for user customization via settings.

### Code Skeleton
Below is a basic implementation that sets up a status bar app, creates an event tap to monitor mouse movement events, and modifies them when the `fn` key is pressed. The app assumes accessibility permissions are granted, which you’ll need to enable in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.

```swift
import Cocoa
import CoreGraphics

@NSApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var statusItem: NSStatusItem?

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        // Set up status bar item
        statusItem = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.variableLength)
        statusItem?.button?.title = "Trackpad Precision"
        let menu = NSMenu()
        menu.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Quit", action: #selector(NSApplication.terminate(_:)), keyEquivalent: ""))
        statusItem?.menu = menu

        // Set up event tap
        let eventMask = CGEventMask(1 << CGEventType.mouseMoved.rawValue)
        guard let eventTap = CGEvent.tapCreate(
            tap: .cgSessionEventTap,
            place: .headInsertEventTap,
            options: .defaultTap,
            eventsOfInterest: eventMask,
            callback: eventTapCallback,
            userInfo: nil
        ) else {
            print("Failed to create event tap. Ensure Accessibility permissions are granted.")
            NSApp.terminate(self)
            return
        }

        let runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(kCFAllocatorDefault, eventTap, 0)
        CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), runLoopSource, .commonModes)
        CGEvent.tapEnable(tap: eventTap, enable: true)
    }
}

func eventTapCallback(proxy: CGEventTapProxy, type: CGEventType, event: CGEvent, refcon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Unmanaged<CGEvent>? {
    if type == .mouseMoved {
        let flags = event.flags
        if flags.contains(.maskSecondaryFn) {
            let deltaX = event.getIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX)
            let deltaY = event.getIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY)
            let factor: Int64 = 4 // Default factor; could be made configurable
            let newDeltaX = deltaX / factor
            let newDeltaY = deltaY / factor
            event.setIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX, newDeltaX)
            event.setIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY, newDeltaY)
        }
    }
    return Unmanaged.passUnretained(event)
}
```

### Next Steps
To use this app, create a new macOS project in Xcode, add the code above, and set `LSUIElement` to `YES` in `Info.plist` to make it a status bar app without a dock icon. Ensure your Mac’s Accessibility settings allow the app to control your computer. For customization, you could add a preferences window to adjust the slowdown factor, stored in `UserDefaults`. Test the app thoroughly, as macOS may restrict certain event modifications, and behavior may vary across versions.

### Detailed Report on Creating a macOS App for Temporary Trackpad Precision Adjustment

#### Introduction
The goal is to develop a macOS application that temporarily increases trackpad cursor precision by slowing its movement when the `fn` key is held, using a customizable factor (defaulting to 4x). This means that for the same physical movement on the trackpad, the cursor moves fewer pixels, allowing for finer control. This report details the research, API selection, development plan, and implementation of key functionalities for such an app, written in Swift, as requested.

#### Research on Existing Solutions
Research indicates that macOS provides options to adjust trackpad tracking speed via System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click, where a slider allows setting the speed from slow to fast ([Apple Support: Change Trackpad Settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-trackpad-settings-mchlp1226/mac)). However, this adjustment is global and requires manual changes, not supporting temporary toggling via a key press. A 2015 Stack Exchange post ([Ask Different: Decrease Trackpad Tracking Speed on Demand](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178195/how-to-decrease-trackpad-tracking-speed-on-demand)) describes a similar need for on-demand trackpad speed reduction, but the user found no satisfactory solutions among tools like MagicPrefs, SmoothMouse, SteerMouse, or ControllerMate. These tools either lacked the specific functionality, were paid, or required complex configurations. The post suggests that a custom script or app might be necessary, indicating that as of 2015, no ready-made solution existed. Given the age of the post, newer solutions were considered, but no recent apps were found that precisely meet the requirement of toggling trackpad speed with the `fn` key.

An alternative approach explored was modifying system settings programmatically using commands like `defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 5.0`, as mentioned in a Stack Exchange discussion ([Ask Different: Increase Tracking Speed Beyond Maximum](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15210/how-to-increase-tracking-speed-beyond-the-maximum)). However, this method requires logging out or rebooting to take effect, making it unsuitable for temporary changes. This led to the conclusion that a custom app using event interception is the most viable solution.

#### API Selection
To achieve dynamic trackpad speed adjustment, the app needs to intercept and modify trackpad input events in real time. macOS’s Quartz Event Services, specifically the `CGEventTap` API, is well-suited for this purpose. According to Apple’s documentation ([Handling Trackpad Events](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingTouchEvents/HandlingTouchEvents.html)), trackpad movements are mapped to mouse movement events (e.g., `kCGEventMouseMoved`). The `CGEventTap` API allows intercepting these events, checking for modifier keys like `fn`, and modifying event properties such as `deltaX` and `deltaY` ([CGEvent Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgevent)).

The `fn` key’s state can be detected using the `kCGEventFlagMaskSecondaryFn` flag in the event’s flags, as confirmed in a Stack Overflow discussion ([Detecting Fn Key on macOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45516031/macos-is-it-possible-to-detect-when-the-fn-key-is-pressed-on-a-mac-keyboard)). This flag is accessible via `CGEventGetFlags`. The `CGEventGetIntegerValueField` and `CGEventSetIntegerValueField` functions allow reading and modifying the movement deltas, enabling the app to scale down cursor movement when the `fn` key is pressed.

A potential challenge is that macOS may restrict modifications to certain events. A Stack Overflow post ([Consuming OSX Mouse/Trackpad Events](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4518559/consuming-osx-mouse-trackpad-events-with-an-event-tap)) notes that returning `NULL` to consume mouse movement events is ignored by the system, but modifying the event’s data (e.g., deltas) and returning it should work. This approach aligns with the need to adjust rather than block events.

#### Development Plan
The app will be a Swift-based macOS status bar application that runs in the background, minimizing user interface clutter. The key components of the plan are:

1. **Project Setup**: Create a macOS app in Xcode, setting `LSUIElement` to `YES` in `Info.plist` to make it a status bar app without a dock icon.
2. **Status Bar Interface**: Implement an `NSStatusItem` with a menu offering a “Quit” option for user control.
3. **Event Tap Creation**: In the `AppDelegate`’s `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, create a `CGEventTap` to monitor `kCGEventMouseMoved` events.
4. **Event Processing**: Define a callback function (`eventTapCallback`) to:
   - Check if the event is a mouse movement event.
   - Retrieve the event’s flags to detect if the `fn` key is pressed.
   - If pressed, scale down `deltaX` and `deltaY` by a factor (default 4).
   - Return the modified event or the original event if the `fn` key is not pressed.
5. **Run Loop Integration**: Add the event tap to the main run loop to ensure continuous operation.
6. **Accessibility Permissions**: Prompt the user to grant accessibility permissions, as `CGEventTap` requires this for event filtering.
7. **Customization (Future)**: Allow the user to adjust the slowdown factor via a preferences window or `UserDefaults`, though initially hardcoded to 4.

#### Implementation of Key Functionalities
The core functionality is implemented in the event tap callback, which modifies mouse movement events. Below is the detailed implementation, wrapped in an artifact for clarity.

```swift
import Cocoa
import CoreGraphics

@NSApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var statusItem: NSStatusItem?

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        // Set up status bar item
        statusItem = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.variableLength)
        statusItem?.button?.title = "Trackpad Precision"
        let menu = NSMenu()
        menu.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Quit", action: #selector(NSApplication.terminate(_:)), keyEquivalent: ""))
        statusItem?.menu = menu

        // Check accessibility permissions
        let options: NSDictionary = [kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeUnretainedValue() as String: true]
        if !AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options) {
            print("Accessibility permissions required. Please enable in System Preferences.")
            // Optionally, open System Preferences to Accessibility pane
        }

        // Set up event tap
        let eventMask = CGEventMask(1 << CGEventType.mouseMoved.rawValue)
        guard let eventTap = CGEvent.tapCreate(
            tap: .cgSessionEventTap,
            place: .headInsertEventTap,
            options: .defaultTap,
            eventsOfInterest: eventMask,
            callback: eventTapCallback,
            userInfo: nil
        ) else {
            print("Failed to create event tap. Ensure Accessibility permissions are granted.")
            NSApp.terminate(self)
            return
        }

        let runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(kCFAllocatorDefault, eventTap, 0)
        CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), runLoopSource, .commonModes)
        CGEvent.tapEnable(tap: eventTap, enable: true)
    }
}

func eventTapCallback(proxy: CGEventTapProxy, type: CGEventType, event: CGEvent, refcon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Unmanaged<CGEvent>? {
    if type == .mouseMoved {
        let flags = event.flags
        if flags.contains(.maskSecondaryFn) {
            let deltaX = event.getIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX)
            let deltaY = event.getIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY)
            let factor: Int64 = 4 // Default factor; could be made configurable
            let newDeltaX = deltaX / factor
            let newDeltaY = deltaY / factor
            event.setIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX, newDeltaX)
            event.setIntegerValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY, newDeltaY)
        }
    }
    return Unmanaged.passUnretained(event)
}
```

#### Additional Considerations
- **Accessibility Permissions**: The app requires accessibility access to create an event tap. The code includes a check using `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` to prompt the user if permissions are missing. You must enable the app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.
- **Customization**: The slowdown factor is hardcoded to 4 but could be stored in `UserDefaults` and modified via a preferences window. For example, add a menu item to open a window where users input a custom factor.
- **System Restrictions**: Some macOS versions may limit event modifications. Testing across versions (e.g., macOS Ventura, Sonoma) is recommended, as older posts suggest issues with event consumption in macOS Catalina.
- **Performance**: Modifying every mouse movement event may introduce slight latency, though `CGEventTap` is designed for low-latency event processing. Monitor performance during testing.
- **Alternative Tools**: Tools like Karabiner-Elements ([Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)) can detect `fn` key presses and might be extended to adjust trackpad behavior, but they require complex configurations and may not directly support delta modification.

#### Potential Challenges
- **Event Modification Reliability**: As noted in a Stack Overflow discussion ([Consuming OSX Mouse/Trackpad Events](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4518559/consuming-osx-mouse-trackpad-events-with-an-event-tap)), macOS may ignore certain event modifications, particularly for mouse movement. If scaling deltas doesn’t work as expected, an alternative could be to post new events with adjusted deltas, though this is more complex.
- **macOS Version Compatibility**: The effectiveness of `defaults write` commands for trackpad scaling has varied across macOS versions (e.g., not working in Catalina). Event tap behavior may also differ, requiring testing on your macOS version.
- **User Experience**: Users must be informed about enabling accessibility permissions. A future enhancement could include a setup wizard to guide this process.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Preferences UI**: Add a preferences window to adjust the slowdown factor, accessible via the status bar menu.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Display a visual indicator (e.g., status bar icon change) when the `fn` key activates precision mode.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for cases where the event tap fails or permissions are denied, possibly retrying or providing detailed user instructions.
- **Gesture Support**: Explore handling multitouch gestures if users need precision for specific trackpad gestures, though this is complex due to gesture event types ([Handling Trackpad Events](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingTouchEvents/HandlingTouchEvents.html)).

#### Table: Key APIs and Their Roles
| API | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `CGEventTapCreate` | Creates an event tap to intercept mouse movement events | Requires accessibility permissions; set to monitor `kCGEventMouseMoved` |
| `CGEventGetFlags` | Retrieves modifier flags to detect `fn` key | Checks for `kCGEventFlagMaskSecondaryFn` |
| `CGEventGetIntegerValueField` | Gets `deltaX` and `deltaY` from mouse events | Used to read movement deltas |
| `CGEventSetIntegerValueField` | Sets modified `deltaX` and `deltaY` | Scales down movement for precision |
| `AXIsProcessTrustedWithევ

#### Conclusion
The proposed Swift-based status bar app using `CGEventTap` to modify trackpad movement events when the `fn` key is pressed appears to be a feasible solution to achieve temporary trackpad precision adjustment. While no existing app fully meets the requirement, the `CGEventTap` approach leverages macOS’s event handling capabilities to provide a seamless user experience. The provided code skeleton implements the core functionality, with room for enhancements like customizable factors and improved permission handling. Thorough testing is recommended to ensure compatibility and performance on your macOS version.

# macOS Trackpad Precision Enhancement App: Research and Implementation Guide

This comprehensive research examines the development of a macOS application that temporarily increases trackpad movement precision when holding the `fn` key, effectively making cursor movement 4x slower for enhanced accuracy. The investigation reveals multiple technical approaches, existing solutions, and implementation strategies using Swift and Core Graphics APIs.

## Understanding Trackpad Movement and Precision Control

macOS trackpad functionality operates through a complex system of hardware inputs, software processing, and cursor translation algorithms. The system's default behavior includes acceleration curves where slow movements provide precision while fast movements enable rapid screen traversal[1][4]. Apple's trackpad implementation uses tracking speed settings that can be adjusted through System Preferences, with values typically ranging from slow to fast configurations[4][12].

The underlying mechanism for trackpad movement involves delta values that represent the change in cursor position relative to finger movement on the trackpad surface[8]. These delta values are processed through Core Graphics event systems, where applications can intercept and modify movement data before it reaches the final cursor position[8][11]. Understanding this pipeline is crucial for implementing precision enhancement functionality.

Current macOS limitations restrict maximum tracking speed to values accessible through System Preferences, with Apple implementing locks on speed modifications in recent versions[9]. However, several workarounds exist through low-level APIs and system defaults manipulation, suggesting that precision control remains technically feasible through proper implementation approaches.

## Existing Solutions and Market Analysis

### Commercial Applications

**SteerMouse** represents the most established solution for cursor speed customization, operating for nearly 20 years with comprehensive mouse and trackpad support[10]. The application provides fine-grained control over speed and acceleration beyond built-in macOS limitations, allowing users to achieve significantly faster cursor movement through minimal physical mouse travel[10]. SteerMouse's approach focuses on both sensitivity and tracking speed adjustments, providing dual-parameter control for optimal cursor behavior.

**BetterTouchTool** offers trackpad customization capabilities but faces limitations on recent macOS versions where Apple restricted speed modifications[9]. The application previously supported extensive trackpad speed control but now encounters system-level restrictions that prevent exceeding System Preferences maximums[9]. Despite these limitations, BetterTouchTool developers have identified potential workarounds using IOHIDServiceClientSetProperty with specific resolution values[9].

### Open Source and Community Solutions

**SmoothMouse** provides trackpad support without interfering with multitouch gestures, focusing specifically on pointing accuracy improvements[6]. The application addresses common mouse acceleration issues in macOS while maintaining full gesture functionality for trackpad users[6]. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of selective modification where precision enhancement doesn't compromise existing trackpad features.

Community-developed solutions include terminal commands for modifying tracking speed through system defaults[7][14]. The command `defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling` allows direct manipulation of trackpad scaling values, with users reporting success using values like 5.0 or higher beyond the standard 3.0 maximum[14]. These approaches require logout/login cycles for activation but provide system-level speed modification capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Core Graphics Event Tapping

The primary technical approach involves using **CGEventTapCreate** for monitoring and modifying trackpad events in real-time[11]. This API enables applications to intercept system events before they reach their final destinations, providing opportunities for delta value modification[11]. Swift implementation requires careful handling of C function pointers and unmanaged memory management, with successful examples demonstrating keyboard and mouse event interception[11].

Event tapping requires specific permission handling, particularly for accessibility access that enables system-wide event monitoring[11]. The implementation must account for modern macOS security requirements while maintaining reliable event processing across system updates and user session changes.

### Delta Value Modification

Cursor movement precision control operates through modification of **kCGMouseEventDeltaX** and **kCGMouseEventDeltaY** values within intercepted events[8]. The process involves capturing original delta values, applying scaling factors (such as 0.25 for 4x precision increase), and reinserting modified values using **CGEventSetIntegerValueField**[8]. This approach maintains system compatibility while providing granular control over movement sensitivity.

Implementation considerations include handling different input devices, managing acceleration curves, and ensuring smooth transitions between normal and precision modes. The scaling algorithm must account for both small and large movements to maintain usable cursor control across various interaction scenarios.

### Key State Monitoring

Function key monitoring requires integration with system event streams to detect key press and release states[11]. The implementation must distinguish between `fn` key events and other system keys while maintaining responsive state changes. Modern macOS implementations may require additional considerations for Touch Bar-equipped devices and different keyboard layouts.

State management becomes critical for handling edge cases such as application switching, system sleep/wake cycles, and unexpected key release events. Robust implementation includes fallback mechanisms to restore normal cursor behavior when precision mode becomes stuck or unresponsive.

### HID Service Integration

Low-level approach involves direct manipulation of **IOHIDServiceClientSetProperty** for trackpad resolution modification[9]. This method provides system-level control over trackpad sensitivity through hardware abstraction layer interactions. The approach offers potential for more comprehensive control but requires careful handling of system permissions and device identification.

HID service integration enables modification of pointer resolution values directly at the hardware interface level, potentially bypassing higher-level restrictions imposed by recent macOS versions[9]. Implementation complexity increases significantly but provides more robust control over trackpad behavior across system updates.

## Implementation Plan and Architecture

### Application Structure

The proposed application follows a modular architecture with distinct components for event monitoring, key state management, and precision control. The main application structure includes:

**EventMonitor** class responsible for CGEventTap creation and management, handling system permissions, and processing trackpad events. This component maintains the primary event loop and ensures reliable event interception across various system states.

**PrecisionController** manages scaling calculations, delta value modifications, and smooth transitions between normal and precision modes. The controller implements configurable scaling factors with user preference storage and validation.

**KeyStateManager** monitors function key states, manages precision mode activation/deactivation, and handles edge cases for key state persistence. This component ensures reliable state tracking across application lifecycle events.

### User Interface Design

The application requires minimal user interface focusing on preference configuration and status indication. Primary interface elements include precision scaling factor adjustment (defaulting to 4x), key combination customization (defaulting to `fn` key), and visual feedback for precision mode activation.

Status indication through menu bar integration provides unobtrusive feedback for current precision state while maintaining easy access to preference modifications. The interface design emphasizes simplicity and immediate usability without complex configuration requirements.

### Permission and Security Handling

Modern macOS security requirements mandate careful permission handling for accessibility access and system event monitoring. The application must guide users through permission granting processes while explaining the necessity for system-level access. Implementation includes graceful degradation when permissions are unavailable and clear error messaging for troubleshooting.

## Code Implementation Skeleton

### Core Event Monitoring Framework

```swift
import Cocoa
import CoreGraphics

class PrecisionTrackpadApp: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    private var eventMonitor: EventMonitor?
    private var precisionController: PrecisionController
    private var keyStateManager: KeyStateManager
    private var statusItem: NSStatusItem?
    
    override init() {
        precisionController = PrecisionController()
        keyStateManager = KeyStateManager()
        super.init()
        setupApplication()
    }
    
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        requestAccessibilityPermissions()
        setupEventMonitoring()
        createStatusBarItem()
    }
    
    private func setupApplication() {
        NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)
    }
    
    private func requestAccessibilityPermissions() {
        let options: NSDictionary = [kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeRetainedValue() as String: true]
        let accessEnabled = AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options)
        
        if !accessEnabled {
            showPermissionAlert()
        }
    }
    
    private func setupEventMonitoring() {
        eventMonitor = EventMonitor(
            precisionController: precisionController,
            keyStateManager: keyStateManager
        )
        eventMonitor?.startMonitoring()
    }
}
```

### Event Monitoring and Processing

```swift
class EventMonitor {
    private var eventTap: CFMachPort?
    private let precisionController: PrecisionController
    private let keyStateManager: KeyStateManager
    private let eventMask: CGEventMask
    
    init(precisionController: PrecisionController, keyStateManager: KeyStateManager) {
        self.precisionController = precisionController
        self.keyStateManager = keyStateManager
        
        // Monitor mouse movement and key events
        self.eventMask = (1  Unmanaged? {
    
    guard let refcon = refcon else { return Unmanaged.passRetained(event) }
    let monitor = Unmanaged.fromOpaque(refcon).takeUnretainedValue()
    
    switch type {
    case .mouseMoved:
        return monitor.handleMouseMovement(event: event)
    case .keyDown, .keyUp, .flagsChanged:
        monitor.handleKeyEvent(event: event, type: type)
        return Unmanaged.passRetained(event)
    default:
        return Unmanaged.passRetained(event)
    }
}
```

### Precision Control Implementation

```swift
class PrecisionController {
    private var precisionFactor: Double = 0.25 // 4x slower (1/4 speed)
    private var isEnabled: Bool = false
    
    func setPrecisionFactor(_ factor: Double) {
        precisionFactor = 1.0 / factor // Convert to scaling factor
    }
    
    func enablePrecisionMode() {
        isEnabled = true
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .precisionModeChanged, object: true)
    }
    
    func disablePrecisionMode() {
        isEnabled = false
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .precisionModeChanged, object: false)
    }
    
    func processMouseMovement(event: CGEvent) -> CGEvent {
        guard isEnabled else { return event }
        
        let originalDeltaX = CGEventGetIntegerValueField(event, .mouseEventDeltaX)
        let originalDeltaY = CGEventGetIntegerValueField(event, .mouseEventDeltaY)
        
        let scaledDeltaX = Int64(Double(originalDeltaX) * precisionFactor)
        let scaledDeltaY = Int64(Double(originalDeltaY) * precisionFactor)
        
        CGEventSetIntegerValueField(event, .mouseEventDeltaX, scaledDeltaX)
        CGEventSetIntegerValueField(event, .mouseEventDeltaY, scaledDeltaY)
        
        return event
    }
}

extension Notification.Name {
    static let precisionModeChanged = Notification.Name("precisionModeChanged")
}
```

### Key State Management

```swift
class KeyStateManager {
    private let precisionController: PrecisionController
    private var fnKeyPressed: Bool = false
    private let targetKeyCode: Int = 63 // fn key code
    
    init(precisionController: PrecisionController) {
        self.precisionController = precisionController
    }
    
    func handleKeyEvent(event: CGEvent, type: CGEventType) {
        let keyCode = Int(CGEventGetIntegerValueField(event, .keyboardEventKeycode))
        let flags = CGEventGetFlags(event)
        
        // Handle fn key specifically
        if keyCode == targetKeyCode || flags.contains(.maskSecondaryFn) {
            handleFnKeyState(type: type, flags: flags)
        }
    }
    
    private func handleFnKeyState(type: CGEventType, flags: CGEventFlags) {
        let fnPressed = flags.contains(.maskSecondaryFn)
        
        if fnPressed != fnKeyPressed {
            fnKeyPressed = fnPressed
            
            if fnPressed {
                precisionController.enablePrecisionMode()
            } else {
                precisionController.disablePrecisionMode()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### User Interface and Preferences

```swift
class StatusBarController {
    private let statusItem: NSStatusItem
    private let menu = NSMenu()
    private let precisionController: PrecisionController
    
    init(precisionController: PrecisionController) {
        self.precisionController = precisionController
        statusItem = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.squareLength)
        setupStatusBar()
        setupMenu()
        observePrecisionChanges()
    }
    
    private func setupStatusBar() {
        if let button = statusItem.button {
            button.image = NSImage(systemSymbolName: "cursorarrow", accessibilityDescription: "Trackpad Precision")
            button.image?.isTemplate = true
        }
        statusItem.menu = menu
    }
    
    private func setupMenu() {
        let precisionSubmenu = NSMenuItem(title: "Precision Factor", action: nil, keyEquivalent: "")
        let submenu = NSMenu()
        
        for factor in [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10] {
            let item = NSMenuItem(
                title: "\(factor)x Slower",
                action: #selector(setPrecisionFactor(_:)),
                keyEquivalent: ""
            )
            item.tag = factor
            item.target = self
            submenu.addItem(item)
        }
        
        precisionSubmenu.submenu = submenu
        menu.addItem(precisionSubmenu)
        menu.addItem(NSMenuItem.separator())
        menu.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Quit", action: #selector(NSApplication.terminate(_:)), keyEquivalent: "q"))
    }
    
    @objc private func setPrecisionFactor(_ sender: NSMenuItem) {
        precisionController.setPrecisionFactor(Double(sender.tag))
        updateMenuSelection(selectedFactor: sender.tag)
    }
    
    private func observePrecisionChanges() {
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
            forName: .precisionModeChanged,
            object: nil,
            queue: .main
        ) { [weak self] notification in
            self?.updateStatusIcon(enabled: notification.object as? Bool ?? false)
        }
    }
    
    private func updateStatusIcon(enabled: Bool) {
        if let button = statusItem.button {
            button.image = NSImage(
                systemSymbolName: enabled ? "cursorarrow.click.2" : "cursorarrow",
                accessibilityDescription: "Trackpad Precision"
            )
        }
    }
}
```

# Building a macOS cursor precision app with fn key control

Building a macOS app that dynamically modifies cursor speed when holding the fn key is technically feasible, though it requires navigating Apple's security permissions and choosing the right combination of APIs. Here's what the research reveals about creating this precision cursor control tool.

## Existing solutions reveal proven patterns

The macOS ecosystem already includes several successful cursor modification apps that demonstrate this functionality is achievable. **LinearMouse** (open source, 4.3k+ GitHub stars) offers the most relevant reference implementation in Swift, providing per-device settings and real-time cursor modification without requiring special permissions beyond accessibility access. Commercial alternatives like **CursorSense** and **SteerMouse** ($20 each) have proven market demand for precision cursor control, with CursorSense specifically offering a precision mode for design work that closely matches your use case.

Most existing solutions use either CGEventTap or IOHIDManager APIs, with CGEventTap being the preferred approach for modern macOS apps. These apps typically consume less than 1% CPU and have minimal battery impact, addressing common performance concerns.

## Technical implementation requires careful API selection

### CGEventTap provides the most practical approach

For your specific requirements, CGEventTap emerges as the optimal API choice. Here's a working Swift implementation pattern:

```swift
class CursorPrecisionController {
    private var eventTap: CFMachPort?
    private var fnKeyPressed = false
    private let precisionScale = 0.25 // 4x slower
    
    func startMonitoring() {
        let eventMask = CGEventMask(
            (1 << CGEventType.mouseMoved.rawValue) |
            (1 << CGEventType.flagsChanged.rawValue)
        )
        
        eventTap = CGEventTapCreate(
            .cgSessionEventTap,
            .headInsertEventTap,
            .defaultTap,
            eventMask,
            eventCallback,
            Unmanaged.passUnretained(self).toOpaque()
        )
        
        let runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(nil, eventTap!, 0)
        CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), runLoopSource, .commonModes)
        CGEventTapEnable(eventTap!, true)
    }
    
    private let eventCallback: CGEventTapCallBack = { _, type, event, refcon in
        let controller = Unmanaged<CursorPrecisionController>.fromOpaque(refcon!).takeUnretainedValue()
        
        if type == .flagsChanged {
            let flags = CGEventGetFlags(event)
            controller.fnKeyPressed = (flags.rawValue & CGEventFlags.maskSecondaryFn.rawValue) != 0
        } else if type == .mouseMoved && controller.fnKeyPressed {
            let deltaX = event.getDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX) * controller.precisionScale

### The fn key presents unique detection challenges

**The fn key requires special handling** because it operates at the hardware level. On Apple keyboards, it uses vendor-specific HID codes (page 0xFF, usage 0x03). Detection methods include:

1. **CGEventTap with kCGEventFlagsChanged**: Most reliable for Apple hardware
2. **NSEvent.modifierFlags.contains(.function)**: Works for global monitoring but requires accessibility permissions
3. **IOHIDManager**: Provides hardware-level access but increases complexity

The fn key detection only works reliably on Apple keyboards. Third-party keyboards may not report fn key events consistently, making this a potential limitation to consider.

## Security permissions shape the user experience

Your app will require **Accessibility permission** to modify cursor events, which users must grant manually in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility. This permission cannot be granted programmatically and will show a system dialog on first launch.

For Mac App Store distribution, you'll need to use a listen-only event tap combined with IOHIDSetAccelerationWithKey for system-level speed changes, as the sandbox environment prohibits direct event modification. The required entitlement is:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.personal-information.input-monitoring</key>
<true/>
```

## Architecture recommendations for production

### Menu bar app provides the best user experience

A menu bar application offers the optimal balance of accessibility and unobtrusiveness. Set `LSUIElement = true` in Info.plist to hide the dock icon while maintaining a status bar presence for settings access. This approach has proven successful for LinearMouse and similar utilities.

### Performance optimization is straightforward

Event tap callbacks must execute in under 1ms to avoid system timeouts. Key optimizations include:
- **Event filtering**: Only monitor mouseMoved and flagsChanged events
- **Rate limiting**: Process at most 120 events per second for smooth 60Hz display support
- **Dedicated processing queue**: Use a high-priority dispatch queue for event handling

### Handle edge cases gracefully

Common issues to address:
- **Multiple input devices**: Differentiate between trackpad and mouse if both are connected
- **Event tap timeouts**: Re-enable the tap if disabled by the system
- **App switching**: Consider whether precision mode should persist when switching applications

## Implementation provides significant user value

Research into existing solutions confirms strong demand for precision cursor control, particularly among designers, developers, and users with accessibility needs. The technical implementation is well-documented through open source projects like LinearMouse, and the performance impact remains minimal when properly implemented.

The combination of CGEventTap for event monitoring and direct delta modification provides a robust solution that works across all macOS versions from 10.15 onwards. While the fn key detection limitation on third-party keyboards exists, Apple's Magic Keyboard and built-in MacBook keyboards will work reliably, covering the majority of use cases.

# ChatGPT report

Thanks! I’ll look into macOS apps or system tools that allow dynamic pointer precision adjustment based on modifier keys like `fn`, with a focus on menu bar utilities or background services. I’ll also investigate the right APIs for implementing this behavior in Swift, and draft a plan for building such an app from scratch if no suitable options exist.

I’ll report back with findings, existing solutions, API insights, and a skeleton app implementation with key functionalities.


# Dynamic Cursor Precision Adjustment on macOS via Modifier Key

## Existing Applications with Cursor Slowdown Features

**BetterTouchTool (BTT):** A popular third-party utility (distributed outside the App Store) can accomplish this. BTT allows configuring a keyboard shortcut or modifier key that toggles between two tracking speeds. In practice, you can set up a shortcut (or even a trackpad gesture with a modifier) and use BTT’s *“Toggle Mouse Speed”* action to switch to a slower cursor speed and back. Users have reported success using BTT to **hold** a key for precision: by assigning one shortcut for key-down and another for key-up (both tied to toggling mouse speed), the cursor slows while the key is held. BTT’s approach essentially changes the system’s mouse tracking speed on the fly. (Note: BTT may list separate controls for Magic Mouse/trackpad vs. regular mice, but in recent versions the “change mouse speed while holding \[key]” function works for standard mice as well.)

**CursorSense:** Another tool (from Plentycom) is a System Preferences pane that offers fine-grained control of mouse acceleration and speed beyond Apple’s defaults. It can adjust cursor sensitivity and acceleration curves system-wide. However, it does not natively support holding a modifier for temporary slowdown – it’s more about setting custom speed/acceleration profiles per device. (In theory, one could manually switch CursorSense profiles, but that’s not as seamless as a key-hold.) CursorSense is not on the App Store (it installs as a .prefPane), so it has the privileges needed to alter mouse settings at a low level.

**Others:** Some gaming mice/software provide a “sniper button” that slows DPI when held – but that’s hardware-specific and not a general solution using the keyboard’s Fn key. Tools like SteerMouse or USB Overdrive (driver-based mouse utilities) allow custom acceleration curves and per-button settings, but they don’t directly support using a keyboard modifier to scale cursor speed. Karabiner-Elements (popular for keyboard remapping) cannot modify mouse movement. For power users, **Hammerspoon** (Lua scripting toolkit) could be scripted to toggle the macOS tracking speed or even intercept mouse events, but this requires writing code. In summary, no lightweight menu bar app was found that *out-of-the-box* does “hold Fn to slow the cursor.” Thus, a custom solution is reasonable.

## macOS APIs for Key Detection and Pointer Control

Achieving this functionality requires tapping into macOS’s lower-level input APIs (which is why the app will need Accessibility permissions). Two key tasks are: **detecting a modifier key press** (especially the Fn key) and **adjusting the cursor speed/precision** in real time.

* **Capturing Modifier Key Press (Fn):** The Fn key is a special case on Mac keyboards. It doesn’t generate a normal `NSEvent` for key down/up that apps can see, and Apple reserves it for system functions (e.g. `NSEventModifierFlagFunction` is deprecated and for system use only). However, you *can* detect Fn at a low level. The hardware key code for Fn is 0x3F (63 in decimal). Using Quartz Event Services, you can query the key state. For example, `CGEventSource.keyState(.hidSystemState, key: 0x3F)` returns whether the Fn key is currently down. This works even though Fn isn’t exposed as a normal modifier flag in Cocoa. For other modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, Option, Command), you can detect those via the event’s modifier flags or via a CGEvent tap for key down/up events easily – Fn just needs the extra step of querying by key code.

* **Global Event Taps:** The Quartz Event Services API allows you to create an event tap to **monitor or intercept input events** system-wide. By creating a CGEvent tap (with `CGEventTapCreate`), you can listen for mouse movements and keyboard events even outside your app. In this case, you would use an event tap to intercept **mouse movement events** and scale them down when the modifier is active. At the lowest level (the *HID* event tap), mouse movements are delivered with delta values (movement deltas in X/Y since the last event). The code can check if our modifier (Fn) is active and then multiply these deltas by a factor (e.g. 0.25 for a 4× slowdown) before the event reaches the OS. This effectively slows the cursor. For example, one developer describes “slowing the mouse cursor by multiplying the mouse delta by \[a fraction] on every mouse move event”. We can achieve this by grabbing the event’s `kCGMouseEventDeltaX` and `...DeltaY` fields and reducing them. The CoreGraphics API provides functions like `CGEventGetDoubleValueField` and `CGEventSetDoubleValueField` to read and modify these fields.

* **Temporarily Changing Tracking Speed:** Another approach is to use IOKit to adjust the system’s mouse speed setting on the fly. macOS represents mouse/trackpad *tracking speed* as a system parameter (accessible via `IOHID` APIs or user defaults). For example, one can call `IOHIDSetAccelerationWithKey` (now superseded by `IOHIDEventSystemClient` methods) to set the “HIDMouseAcceleration” to a new value. A Swift script on Reddit demonstrates holding a modifier to change this value – on key down it sets a higher speed, and on key up it restores the default. In our case, we’d set a *lower* speed when Fn is down. The tracking speed ranges are somewhat discrete (macOS only supports certain step values for acceleration/speed), so you might not get exactly a 4× difference using this method. It may result in, say, 3× or 5× depending on nearest allowed values. Still, it’s an option. The advantage of toggling the system setting is simplicity (let the OS apply the slower speed curve), but the potential downsides are slight latency in applying the change and the coarse granularity of speed settings. In contrast, intercepting and scaling the events manually can give a precise 4× slowdown effect.

* **Accessibility API Permissions:** Both approaches above require the app to be granted **Accessibility** privileges (a.k.a “Input Monitoring” or “Assistive Device” access). This is because intercepting system events or modifying system settings programmatically crosses out of the app sandbox. The app should use `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` (from ApplicationServices) to prompt the user to enable the permission. The user will need to approve this in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, which is expected for utilities controlling input.

## Designing a Swift Menu Bar Utility

Given the above, we can outline a solution. The app will run as a background menu bar app (with no Dock icon). You can achieve this by setting `LSUIElement` to true in the app’s Info.plist so it only appears in the menu bar. The high-level design is:

1. **Menu Bar Setup:** Initialize an `NSStatusBar` item in your `AppDelegate` (or SwiftUI App) for the app’s icon/menu. The menu might include options like enabling/disabling the feature, setting the slow-down factor, choosing the modifier key (default Fn), and quitting.

2. **Accessibility Permission Check:** On launch, check `AXIsProcessTrusted()`. If not trusted, call `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` with the appropriate dictionary to prompt the user (this can automatically open System Settings to the Accessibility section). The app should wait or periodically check until permission is granted before activating the event tap.

3. **Event Tap for Mouse & Keyboard:** Set up a global event tap to intercept the necessary events. You’ll use `CGEventTapCreate` with:

   * Location: `.cgHIDEventTap` (to get low-level events before they’re handled by the system).
   * Placement: `.headInsertEventTap` (so we get events first).
   * Options: `.defaultTap` (to allow us to modify events).
   * Events of interest: mouse movement events and key events. Specifically, you need `kCGEventMouseMoved` plus the drag variants (`kCGEventLeftMouseDragged`, `kCGEventRightMouseDragged`, etc.) so that slow mode also applies when dragging objects. You’ll also listen for keyboard events that indicate the modifier press/release. For normal modifiers like Shift or Ctrl, you could listen for `flagsChanged` events or specific key down/up of those keys. For Fn, since it doesn’t broadcast a normal event by itself, you might alternatively poll its state (more on this below).

4. **Modifier Key State Tracking:** Maintain a boolean (e.g. `slowModeActive`). When the chosen modifier is pressed, set this to true; when released, set it false. For keys like Shift or Option, the event tap can detect a `flagsChanged` event where `event.getIntegerValueField(.keyboardEventKeycode)` matches the key’s code (e.g. 56 for Shift). For Fn, one approach is to use a small concurrent event tap for **all** key events and watch for any key where CGEvent flag for Fn is set – but since Fn is mostly transparent, the simpler method is to query its state on each mouse event. For example, inside the mouse event callback, call `if CGEventSource.keyState(.hidSystemState, key: 0x3F) { slowModeActive = true } else { slowModeActive = false }`. This effectively checks Fn’s state at the time of each movement. (Alternatively, use a CGEvent tap for `.flagsChanged` and treat the Fn-down as a flags change. Some keyboards might generate a flags change for Fn – if so, the keycode will be 63 – but this isn’t reliable on all Macs.)

5. **Adjusting Pointer Speed:** When `slowModeActive` is true, modify the incoming mouse events. Using the Quartz event tap callback, you can scale down the pointer movement:

   * Get the event’s delta values: `let dx = event.getDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX)` and similarly for `.mouseEventDeltaY`.
   * Divide these by the desired factor (4 by default). For example, `event.setDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX, value: dx/4.0)` and same for Y. This reduces the reported movement to 25%, resulting in slower cursor travel.
   * You might also want to handle high-resolution mouse movements (if any) via `mouseEventDeltaX`/`Y` being floats, but `getDoubleValueField` covers that.
   * If using the system setting toggle method instead: On key down, read the current setting (so you can restore it later), then apply a reduced value (e.g. if current speed is 1.0, set 0.25). On key up, restore the original. The code to set the value can use `IOHIDEventSystemClientCreate` and `IOHIDSetAccelerationWithKey` as shown in the Reddit example (setting `kIOHIDMouseAccelerationType`). Note that Apple’s APIs are a bit arcane here – the Reddit code obtains an event system client and directly sets the acceleration factor.

6. **Run Loop and Event Tap Lifecycle:** Once the event tap is created, add it to the run loop (`CFRunLoopAddSource`). Enable the tap (`CGEvent.tapEnable(...)`) and start the run loop (or simply return to the main run loop if on the main thread). The tap callback will now fire for events. Be sure to handle the case where the tap might be disabled by the system (if events flood or if accessibility permission is lost) – in such case, you may need to re-enable or recreate the tap. Also, on app termination, remove the tap.

7. **Optional – Modifier Customization:** To allow a custom modifier instead of Fn, you could present a menu listing keys or listen for a user-defined hotkey. In that case, your logic would change which keycode/flag you monitor. For example, if the user chooses Caps Lock or another seldom-used key as the “slow” key, you’d monitor that instead. (Keep in mind Caps Lock is a toggle by default – you might remap it to act like a momentary modifier for this purpose.)

Given these steps, below is a **skeletal Swift implementation** illustrating the core parts:

```swift
import Cocoa
import Carbon.HIToolbox // for kVK_* keycodes constants

class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    let statusItem = NSStatusBar.system.statusItem(withLength: NSStatusItem.variableLength)
    var slowKey: CGKeyCode = 0x3F  // default to Fn key (0x3F = 63):contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
    var slowFactor: Double = 4.0   // 4x slower
    private var slowModeActive = false
    private var eventTap: CFMachPort?

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ note: Notification) {
        // 1. Request Accessibility permission if needed
        let options: NSDictionary = [kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeRetainedValue() as NSString: true]
        guard AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options) else {
            NSLog("Please enable Accessibility permissions for this app in System Settings.")
            // We can periodically check again or observe, but for brevity just return and wait.
            return 
        }

        // 2. Create event tap for mouse move and keyboard events
        let mask: CGEventMask = (1 << CGEventType.mouseMoved.rawValue)
                              | (1 << CGEventType.leftMouseDragged.rawValue)
                              | (1 << CGEventType.rightMouseDragged.rawValue)
                              | (1 << CGEventType.otherMouseDragged.rawValue)
                              | (1 << CGEventType.flagsChanged.rawValue)  // to catch modifier changes
        if let tap = CGEvent.tapCreate(tap: .cgHIDEventTap, place: .headInsertEventTap,
                                       options: .defaultTap, eventsOfInterest: mask,
                                       callback: { [weak self] (_, type, event, _) -> Unmanaged<CGEvent>? in
            guard let self = self else { return Unmanaged.passUnretained(event) }
            if type == .flagsChanged {
                // A modifier key state changed. Check if it’s our slow key (non-Fn mods).
                let keyCode = CGKeyCode(event.getIntegerValueField(.keyboardEventKeycode))
                if keyCode == self.slowKey {
                    // For Fn: this may or may not trigger. For other keys, this works.
                    self.slowModeActive = event.flags.contains(.maskSecondaryFn) || event.flags.contains(.maskCommand) 
                        || event.flags.contains(.maskShift) // etc., depending on chosen mod
                    // (maskSecondaryFn is a CGEventFlag for Fn; works on Apple Silicon for Fn in combination events)
                }
            }
            if type == .mouseMoved || type == .leftMouseDragged || type == .rightMouseDragged || type == .otherMouseDragged {
                // For Fn, we’ll poll the state because Fn might not send flagsChanged alone
                if !self.slowModeActive, self.slowKey == 0x3F {
                    self.slowModeActive = CGEventSource.keyState(.hidSystemState, key: self.slowKey)  //:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
                }
                if self.slowModeActive {
                    // Scale down cursor movement
                    let dx = event.getDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX)
                    let dy = event.getDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY)
                    event.setDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaX, value: dx / self.slowFactor)
                    event.setDoubleValueField(.mouseEventDeltaY, value: dy / self.slowFactor)
                }
            }
            return Unmanaged.passRetained(event)  // forward (possibly modified) event
        }, userInfo: nil) {
            eventTap = tap
            // Add to run loop
            let runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(kCFAllocatorDefault, tap, 0)
            CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), runLoopSource, .commonModes)
            CGEvent.tapEnable(tap: tap, enable: true)
        } else {
            NSLog("Failed to create event tap. Ensure the app has Accessibility permission.")
        }

        // 3. Set up status bar menu (at least a Quit option)
        if let button = statusItem.button {
            button.title = "⌖"  // some icon or text
        }
        let menu = NSMenu()
        menu.addItem(NSMenuItem(title: "Quit SlowCursor", action: #selector(handleQuit), keyEquivalent: "q"))
        statusItem.menu = menu
    }

    @objc func handleQuit() {
        if let tap = eventTap {
            CGEvent.tapEnable(tap: tap, enable: false)
            CFMachPortInvalidate(tap)
        }
        NSApp.terminate(nil)
    }
}
```

In the above skeleton, the event tap monitors both keyboard modifier changes and mouse movement. For a non-Fn key (say you chose Shift as the slow key), the `.flagsChanged` branch will catch when Shift is pressed or released and set `slowModeActive` accordingly. For Fn, we supplement this by explicitly checking `CGEventSource.keyState` on each move event, because Fn may not produce a standalone event on its own. We use the **HID event tap** so that we can intercept raw mouse delta values before macOS acceleration is applied. We then scale the `deltaX` and `deltaY` by our factor (dividing by 4). The modified event is then passed through, resulting in the cursor moving a shorter distance than it normally would for the same physical mouse movement. The result is a slower, more precise cursor movement while the key is held. When the key is released, `slowModeActive` goes false and events pass unmodified, restoring normal speed.

## Additional Considerations

* **Restoring State:** If using the “modify events” approach, once the key is released, new events automatically use the normal deltas again (since our flag is off). If using the “change system setting” approach, make sure to *restore the original tracking speed* value when the key is released. You’d retrieve the user’s default speed at launch (for example, via `IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty` for `HIDMouseAcceleration` or even reading `defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling`) and reapply it on key up.

* **Performance:** The event tap method is quite efficient for this task. Scaling a couple of numbers per mouse event is trivial work. Apps like LinearMouse and Mos (which smooth or alter scroll events) use similar CGEventTaps and report low CPU usage. Still, test the app while moving the mouse rapidly to ensure it doesn’t lag. If the CPU usage is unexpectedly high, you might be intercepting more events than needed or doing expensive work in the callback. In our design, the logic is simple and only a handful of branches and arithmetic, so it should be fine.

* **Fn Key Caveats:** On some Macs, the Fn key modifies other keys (e.g. Fn + Delete = Forward Delete). Our approach of querying the Fn state works for detecting a lone Fn press on built-in keyboards. If the user is on an external keyboard without an Fn (or if Fn is configured for special functions like dictation or emoji on newer macOS), they might prefer using a different modifier. Providing an option to use, say, the **Option key** or a combination like Ctrl+Option as the slow-down trigger could be useful. Those keys are easier to detect (and won’t conflict with global shortcuts if chosen carefully).

* **Sandbox and App Store:** As noted, this utility must run with Accessibility privileges. This means it cannot be sandboxed, and thus you **would not distribute it via the Mac App Store** (which forbids the necessary APIs). Distribution can be done via a notarized `.app` download. The user’s manual step of granting Accessibility permission is expected. Our code uses `CGEventTapCreate` with `.cgHIDEventTap`, which will fail (return NULL) if the app is not trusted for accessibility. Always handle that case (as shown by logging an error and prompting the user).

* **Testing:** When building such an app, test with different input devices. For instance, a high-DPI gaming mouse vs. a trackpad – the delta scaling method should work uniformly, but the perceived speed change will depend on the device’s base sensitivity. Also test pressing the modifier key alone, and in combination with mouse button clicks, to ensure it doesn’t interfere with dragging or other interactions.

By following this plan, you will have a Swift-based menu bar application that watches for the Fn key and dynamically reduces cursor movement speed by a factor (4× slower by default) while it’s held. This provides a “precision mode” for fine control, which can be especially helpful for tasks like graphic design, CAD, or any scenario where you need to carefully position the mouse cursor.

# engine-implementations

The project implements two specialized temporal alignment engines for video synchronization:

## Full Engine (Default)
The primary temporal alignment engine using direct pixel-level comparison:

1. **Bidirectional Frame Matching**
- Forward pass starts from first foreground frame
- Backward pass starts from last foreground frame
- Merges both passes for optimal alignment
- Enforces strict monotonicity via sliding window constraints
- Uses direct pixel-by-pixel frame comparison

2. **Key Characteristics**  
- Zero drift by design through monotonic constraints
- Perfect confidence scores (1.000)
- Processing speed ~5x realtime
- Optimal for standard video content

## Mask Engine
Enhanced alignment engine for letterboxed/pillarboxed content:

1. **Intelligent Content Masking**
- Auto-detects non-black content regions
- Generates binary masks to focus comparison
- Ignores letterboxing and black borders
- Maintains same bidirectional matching approach

2. **Content-Focused Comparison** 
- Only compares pixels within detected content mask
- More robust for varying aspect ratios
- Handles videos where content doesn't fill frame
- Perfect confidence scores (1.000)

Both engines share core functionality:

- Sliding window constraints to prevent temporal jumps
- Sequential frame reading for 10-100x faster compositing
- Bidirectional matching for robust alignment
- Zero drift by design through monotonic mapping
- Processing speed of ~5-6x realtime
- Memory-efficient streaming frame processing

Key differences:
| Feature | Full Engine | Mask Engine |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Primary Use | Standard videos | Letterboxed content |
| Comparison | All pixels | Content regions only |
| Processing | Faster | Slightly slower |
| Best For | Full-frame content | Partial-frame content |

# video-processing-flow

The video processing pipeline consists of four major stages that work together to achieve precise video synchronization and composition:

## Core Pipeline Architecture

1. **Video Analysis Stage**
- Extracts metadata from source videos using ffprobe
- Captures essential parameters: resolution, FPS, duration, frame count
- Validates audio stream presence and characteristics
- Importance Score: 85

2. **Spatial Alignment Stage** 
- Determines optimal foreground placement coordinates
- Takes mid-video frame samples from both sources
- Uses template matching for position detection
- Returns (x,y) offset coordinates
- Importance Score: 90

3. **Temporal Alignment Stage**
- Creates frame-to-frame mapping between videos
- Generates compact frame fingerprints 
- Uses sliding window DTW algorithm for alignment
- Maintains monotonic frame progression
- Importance Score: 95

4. **Video Composition Stage**
- Sequential frame reading and composition
- Applies spatial and temporal mappings
- Handles audio track integration
- Preserves foreground video timing
- Importance Score: 85

## Alignment Algorithm Integration

### Temporal Engines
- **Full Engine**
  - Direct frame comparison
  - Forward and backward alignment passes
  - Fixed-size sliding window constraints
  - Importance Score: 95

- **Mask Engine**  
  - Content-focused frame matching
  - Automatic letterbox detection
  - Region-based comparisons
  - Importance Score: 90

### Frame Synchronization Flow
1. Frame fingerprint generation
2. Bidirectional alignment pass
3. Monotonic path construction
4. Frame mapping validation
Importance Score: 85

### Data Flow Between Components
1. Analysis results -> Spatial alignment
2. Spatial coordinates -> Temporal engine
3. Frame mappings -> Composition
4. Audio sync data -> Final output
Importance Score: 80

_**Assistant**_

I can see the output from running `run.sh`. There are several issues that need to be addressed:

## Issues Identified:

1. **Shell configuration warnings**: The script is trying to use bash-specific options that aren't available in the current shell
2. **Missing xcpretty**: The build tool `xcpretty` is not installed
3. **NVM not found**: The script references `/Users/adam/.nvm/nvm.sh` which doesn't exist
4. **CoreSimulator version mismatch**: The CoreSimulator framework is outdated (1010.10.0) compared to what Xcode expects (1010.15.0)
5. **macOS using zsh by default**: The system is suggesting to switch from bash to zsh

## Solutions:

Let me first check the content of the `run.sh` script to understand what it's trying to do: Now let me check the rest of the script: Now I understand the script better. The main issues are:

1. **CoreSimulator version mismatch** - This is the most critical issue preventing the build
2. **Missing xcpretty** - This is a nice-to-have tool for prettier xcodebuild output

Let me check if the build actually succeeded despite the warnings:

## 1  |  Orient yourself

1. **Clone & open the repo** in Xcode (15 +).
2. **Locate `_private/research.md`** and read it end-to-end.
   *While reading, jot quick notes about any APIs, UX constraints, or unanswered questions you spot.*

---

## 2  |  Digest & think deeply

Spend **30-60 min of focused thinking** (no coding yet):

* Summarise the research in your own words.
* Sketch the user flow: *finger moves → CGEvent generated → fn flag pressed → dragoboo scales delta → OS receives adjusted event*.
* List every unknown (“How do I detect the ↩︎ `fn` flag globally?” etc.) and draft hypotheses or docs to consult.

---

## 3  |  Write `PLAN.md`

Create a new file at project root:

```
PLAN.md
```

Structure it as an **unchecked checklist** – each item starts with `[ ]` and is a *single, testable deliverable*, for example:

```
[ ] Prototype CGEvent tap that logs raw deltaX/Y
```

A good PLAN.md contains **two layers**:

1. **High-level phases** (Research → Architecture → Implementation → Packaging → QA/Release).
2. **Concrete deliverables** nested beneath each phase, each phrased so someone can literally tick it off when done.

Keep it exhaustive but not prescriptive about *how* to solve each item—that lives in the code & docs.

---

## 4  |  Write `TODO.md`

This is the *very next sprint* (today & tomorrow).
Keep it short (≤ 10 items). Examples:

```
[ ] Set up Xcode app template (macOS, SwiftUI lifecycle)
[ ] Add Swift Package “HIDMouse” scaffold
[ ] Spike CGEvent tap that prints delta at 60 Hz
[ ] Detect flagsChanged and log .function key state
[ ] Divide delta by 4 while fn held; verify manually
[ ] Persist multiplier in UserDefaults (default 4)
```

---

## 5  |  Implementation guidelines (what “good Swift macOS” looks like)

| Topic                        | Technique / Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project setup**            | Swift 5.10, Swift Package Manager **only** (no Cocoapods). Modularise into `DragobooCore` (logic) and `DragobooApp` (UI).                                                                                  |
| **UI**                       | **SwiftUI** for all visible UI; menu-bar‐only app via `@main` + `MenuBarExtra` for settings sheet.                                                                                                         |
| **Event processing**         | Use **CGEventTap** (`CGEventTapCreate`) at the “HID” tap point to intercept `kCGEventMouseMoved`, `kCGEventScrollWheel`, etc. Manipulate `deltaX`/`deltaY` fields *in place*, divide by `precisionFactor`. |
| **Modifier-key detection**   | Handle **`flagsChanged` NSEvent** via `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`. The `fn` key toggles the `.function` flag bit 0x8000. Maintain an `@Published var fnPressed: Bool`.                             |
| **Concurrency**              | Non-UI work (e.g. monitoring or I/O) uses Swift **async/await** + `Actor` for thread-safe state.                                                                                                           |
| **Architecture**             | MV-VM: `PointerScalerActor` owns tap & scaling; `SettingsViewModel` owns preferences; `ContentView` binds via `@ObservedObject`.                                                                           |
| **Persistence**              | `@AppStorage("precisionFactor")` (default 4).                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Preferences UI**           | SwiftUI slider/stepper for factor (0.5–10 ×), live preview.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Error handling & logging** | Use Apple’s `os.Logger` (`log(_:level:)`). Guard every C-API call; fall back gracefully if Event Tap fails (e.g. display alert & disable scaling).                                                         |
| **Testing**                  | Unit-test pure math (scaling), UI tests for preference changes. Leverage `XCTest` + `testable import`.                                                                                                     |
| **Signing & distribution**   | Hardened runtime, Developer ID cert. Create a LaunchAgent plist so the app restarts on login.                                                                                                              |
| **Accessibility & privacy**  | Document that users must grant **Accessibility → Input Monitoring** in System Settings; prompt with `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`.                                                                       |
| **Code style**               | SwiftLint + swift-format default rules. Docstrings in Apple-style markdown.                                                                                                                                |

## 6  |  Start coding (but keep it incremental)

1. **Initial spike:** hard-code `/4` scaling; prove the concept end-to-end.
2. **Refactor into `DragobooCore`** once the spike works.
3. **Wire up SwiftUI settings**, persistence, and dynamic factor changes.
4. **Polish:** zero CPU wakeups when idle, battery impact check, edge-case testing (multiple monitors, hi-DPI, etc.).
5. **PR early & often.** Each checklist item → git branch → PR.

---

### Reminders for the junior dev

* **Readability > cleverness.** Clear names & comments.
* **Fail safely.** If the tap can’t activate, surface a user-friendly banner and exit.
* **Keep PLAN.md & TODO.md living documents.** Update as you learn.
* **Commit often, push daily.** Small PRs enable fast review.

# Dragoboo

A macOS app that temporarily increases trackpad/mouse precision when holding the `fn` key.

## Features

- Hold `fn` key to slow down cursor movement by a customizable factor (default 4×)
- Menu bar app with minimal UI
- Adjustable precision factor (1-10×)
- Works with trackpad and mouse
- Supports all mouse actions (move, drag, scroll)

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0+
- Accessibility permissions must be granted

## Building

### Option 1: Command Line (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and run
./run.sh

# Or use make
make run

# Other options
./run.sh --help      # Show all options
./run.sh --release   # Build release version
./run.sh --clean     # Clean build before building
./stop.sh            # Stop running app
```

### Option 2: Xcode

1. Open `Dragoboo.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+
2. Build and run (⌘R)
3. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted

## Usage

1. Launch Dragoboo - it will appear in your menu bar
2. Click the menu bar icon to access settings
3. Hold the `fn` key while moving your trackpad/mouse for precision mode
4. Adjust the slowdown factor using the slider (1-10×)

## Architecture

- **DragobooApp**: SwiftUI menu bar application
- **DragobooCore**: Core event handling logic using CGEventTap
- **PointerScaler**: Manages event interception and delta scaling

## Privacy & Security

Dragoboo requires accessibility permissions to intercept and modify mouse events. The app:
- Does not collect any data
- Does not connect to the internet
- Only modifies mouse movement when fn key is held
